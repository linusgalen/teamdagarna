    <h1 class="title">Interviews</h1>

    <p>TEAM offers students the possibility to meet business representatives from a range of companies during a private conversation about jobs and future possibilities. This is a great way to establish a connection with the company of your choice, but should by no means be considered a job interview. Applications for so called “mock interviews” will open in advance,
      and the interviews themselves take place digitally on the 22th of September. Keep an eye out for information regarding application 
      deadlines and companies that offer interviews!</p>
    <br>
    <h1 class="title">Events</h1>

    <p>Due to the ongoing pandemic, there will be a limited amount of events arranged. More information regarding planned events will be announced soon.  </p>
